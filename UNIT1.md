### Core Components of Blockchain

1. **Node:**
   - **Definition:** A computer connected to the blockchain network, which validates and relays transactions.
   - **Types:**
     - **Full Nodes:** Store the entire blockchain and validate all transactions and blocks.
     - **Light Nodes:** Store only a subset of the blockchain and rely on full nodes for validation.
     - **Mining Nodes:** Validate transactions and create new blocks through the mining process.
   - **Role:** Ensure network integrity and security by validating and propagating transactions and blocks.

2. **Ledger:**
   - **Definition:** A digital record of all transactions that have occurred on the blockchain.
   - **Characteristics:** Immutable, transparent, and distributed across all nodes.
   - **Role:** Provides a permanent and tamper-proof record of all transactions.

3. **Wallet:**
   - **Definition:** A digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.
   - **Types:**
     - **Software Wallets:** Installed on a computer or mobile device.
     - **Hardware Wallets:** Physical devices that store private keys offline.
     - **Paper Wallets:** Printed documents containing private keys and QR codes.
     - **Web Wallets:** Hosted online by third parties.
   - **Role:** Manages private keys and interacts with the blockchain to facilitate transactions.

4. **Smart Contract:**
   - **Definition:** Self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.
   - **Characteristics:** Automated, transparent, and enforceable without intermediaries.
   - **Role:** Execute predefined actions when certain conditions are met, enabling complex transactions and applications.

5. **Consensus Mechanism:**
   - **Definition:** Protocols that ensure all nodes in the network agree on the blockchain's state.
   - **Types:**
     - **Proof of Work (PoW):** Requires computational effort to solve complex puzzles.
     - **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Validators are chosen based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake."
     - **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** Stakeholders elect a small number of delegates to validate transactions and create new blocks.
